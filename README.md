# Pixori-prototype

## 🔍 Introduction

BEYOND-Flow team is working on a project related to [Flow](https://www.onflow.org/) that seeks the foundation of the Digital Asset Open World. We have established communication with Flow blockchain developer team called Dapper Labs, which developed Crypto Kitties and NBA Top Shot. Currently, we are developing new service items for user to purchase and trade Flow NFT-based digital assets. We aim to explore the potential for new crypto economic development with NFT and deliver truly user-friendly digital assets.

This repository is for Cadence smart contracts that define core functionality of our service.
